# Disney+ Subscriber Retention: Mixed-Methods Research Framework

## Project Overview
This project presents a strategic research framework designed to identify and quantify the predictors of subscriber churn for Disney+’s ad-supported tier. In an increasingly saturated streaming market, understanding the trade-offs between cost savings and ad-exposure is critical for maintaining a competitive advantage.

The framework employs a **mixed-methods approach**, bridging the gap between qualitative emotional drivers and quantitative statistical significance to provide actionable insights for data-driven retention strategies.

## Key Research Questions
* **Predictive Drivers**: Which specific ad-related concerns (intrusiveness, appropriateness, ad load) are most strongly associated with a parent's intention to cancel Disney+? 
* [**Segment Analysis**: How do these perceptions vary across parent segments defined by child age, household income, and co-viewing habits? 

## Research Methodology

### Phase I: Qualitative Discovery (In-Depth Interviews)
* **Objective**: Uncover the emotional and contextual dynamics behind subscription decisions.
* **Instrument**: Developed a structured interview guide targeting U.S. parents to explore "value perception," "ad disruption tolerance," and "triggers for churn".
* **Outcome**: Identified key thematic codes used to inform the subsequent quantitative survey design.

### Phase II: Quantitative Validation (Online Survey)
* **Objective**: Measure the prevalence of concerns and test statistical relationships between variables.
* **Instrument**: Designed a 10-point survey optimized for busy parents, utilizing Likert scales to capture the strength of attitudes toward ad relevance and brand trust.
* **Dependent Variable**: Retention Intention (cancellation likelihood within 3 months).

### Phase III: Statistical Analysis Plan
* **Multiple Linear Regression**: Proposed model using six to seven predictors (intrusiveness, appropriateness, value, etc.) to isolate the strongest drivers of retention intention.
* **Subgroup Analysis**: Plan for cross-tabulations and interaction analyses to identify specific segments (e.g., parents of children aged 6-12) with unique ad-tolerance thresholds.
  
## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the framework, the study outlines potential interventions for Disney+ leadership:
* **Ad Experience Design**: Implementing frequency caps or reducing disruptive ad placements if "intrusiveness" is identified as a primary churn driver.
* **Messaging Strategy**: Developing "Smart Value for Families" campaigns to reinforce the brand promise of safe, high-quality entertainment.
* **Pricing Optimization**: Adjusting pricing strategies for price-sensitive segments to maintain satisfaction and reduce attrition.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Research Design**: Mixed-methods (Qualitative + Quantitative).
* **Analytical Software**: Plan for data analysis in R and Excel.
* **Business Strategy**: Subscriber Churn Analysis, Customer Segmentation, and ROI Optimization.
